                We currently ship all items delivery duty unpaid (DDU). Gooseberry is not responsible for any 
                customs charges or local taxes due to international shipment. Please familiarize yourself 
                with your countries regulations as payment of these duties may be necessary to release your order. 
                Note: there are NO customs duties incurred on parcels within Australia.

                If you refuse a shipment from Gooseberry you are responsible for the original shipping 
                charges, any import fees that may have incurred on the package, as well as the cost of returning 
                your order parcel to Gooseberry. This amount will be deducted from your order refund once the 
                shipment has been received back.

                By placing an order you are acknowledging and accepting all
